# Emotion Detection Using CNNs

This project implements a facial emotion recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It is trained on the FER2013 dataset and uses a modified VGG-16 architecture to classify seven different emotions from facial expressions.

## Introduction
Facial emotion recognition is a significant field in artificial intelligence, with applications in security, healthcare, education, and human-computer interaction. The project uses a CNN-based approach to classify images into seven emotions: **Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral**.

## Dataset
The project uses the [FER2013 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013), which contains **35,887 grayscale images (48x48 pixels)**, each labeled with one of seven emotions. The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

## Model Architecture
The model is based on the **VGG-16** architecture with modifications:
- **Convolutional layers** for feature extraction
- **MaxPooling layers** for dimensionality reduction
- **Global Average Pooling** to reduce overfitting
- **Fully connected layers** for classification
- **Softmax activation** for multi-class classification

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/quynhphamduong/Emotion-Detection-Using-CNNs.git
cd Emotion-Detection-Using-CNNs
```

### 2. Set up the environment
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Train the model
Run the Jupyter Notebook `Build_the_model.ipynb` on Google Colab to train the model.

### Test the model
Use `TestModel.ipynb` to evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy.

## Results
The model achieved **~60% accuracy** on the test set due to dataset limitations and model overfitting. Below is a confusion matrix showing class-wise performance:
